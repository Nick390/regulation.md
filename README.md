#### How is the title chosen?
An address is chosen on the largest thing that has been done,for example writing a file consisting of 1000 lines of 
software is more powerful in mentioning than renaming a file this is due to the preference of those who did a job
but when the (push origin) done you have to choose the trick is to make it accurate and attractive at the same time.

#### In optional extended description
Here you sail and go deeper into it. You must mention everything you have done, including that in the main title.
You must put an asterisk`*`before each item and a point at the end of each item you have made.
##### Examples
* `**Add text coloring property.`

#### How to format file and folders names in the system core?
Using uppercase and lowercase letters was useful in the past, but now because the project has become large, it was decided to make the names in small English letters only; And the words are separated with a symbol `_`.

#### How are tables named in the database?
* No specific method of naming has been specified, but now there is a law so that all column names must be in lowercase letters only.
* The underscore symbol `_` is used to distinguish between words.
* A comments must be created to describe what each column does.
