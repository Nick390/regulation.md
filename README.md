Using uppercase and lowercase letters was useful in the past, but now because the project has become large, it was decided to make the names in small English letters only; And the words are separated with a symbol `_`.

#### How are tables named in the database?
* No specific method of naming has been specified, but now there is a law so that all column names must be in lowercase letters only.
* The underscore symbol `_` is used to distinguish between words.

#### Timestamp
